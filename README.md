# PP-SP_S01_Flutter

An objective is what you want to do during this session of PP-SP. It’s sort of by priority and logic (starting wall before building the roof).

Primary Objectifs means you will achieve them, it’s an obligation that you impose to yourself. You can’t cancel it or give up. You can add one along the way.

Secondary Objectifs means you would like to achieve them, they are not mandatory, it’s a bonus. You can start them and give up on the way, start and achieve, or even cancel it. You can add one along the way.

Objectives are there to help you, you for you. Structure your thinking, organise you, find objectives, not lose the path you want to follow. This form is public, one reason for this is bringing interactivity between people’s objectives.
